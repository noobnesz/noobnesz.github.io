# a summary about you
summary: |
  I am Keith, a DevOps/Site Reliability Engineer with 8+ years of experience in the Information Technology sector.

  Being proficient with Terraform, I believe provisioning reliable, highly available, and cost-efficient cloud infrastructure is my strongest suite. I also have a solid grasp in deploying containerized Docker services to the cloud with orchestration and templating tools such as Kubernetes and Helm.

  Reducing toil has been always been my favorite thing to do in an organization ever since I stepped foot into the industry. I achieve this by developing automation in various CI/CD implementations such as Gitlab CI, Spinnaker, Jenkins, and even good old Bash scripts!

  Cultivating the SRE culture in an organization has been a recent passion of mine, and what better way to do it than having observability? Implementing dashboards-as-code in Grafana has been my pet project and it gives me satisfaction to see it in action.

  My goal right now is to have a challenging role that would test my skills as a DevOps/SRE practitioner, with a strong focus in observability and system architecting.
